# WeatherAnalysisProject

The project Presents a strict comparison between three Machine Learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), for Time-Series predictions of Weather Dataset.

Various techniques like Regularization, Normalization and Data Preprocessing have been applied to achieve best possible output for each method.

The results have been presented on a frontend in a graphical format using Angular as front-end technology.
